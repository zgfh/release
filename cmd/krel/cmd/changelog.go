	Long: fmt.Sprintf(`krel changelog

To let this tool work, please point '--repo' to a local copy of the target k/k
repository. This local checkout will be modified during the run of 'krel
changelog' and should contain all changes from the remote location. Beside this,
a valid %s=<TOKEN> environment variable has to be exported to let the generation
of the release notes work.

The 'changelog' subcommand of 'krel' does the following things by utilizing
the golang based 'release-notes' tool:

1. Generate the release notes for either a patch or a new minor release. Minor
   releases can be alpha, beta or rcâ€™s, too.
   a) Create a new CHANGELOG-x.y.md file if not existing.
   b) Correctly prepend the generated notes to the existing CHANGELOG-x.y.md
      file if already existing. This also includes the modification of the
	  table of contents.

2. Convert the markdown release notes into a HTML equivalent on purpose of
   sending it by mail to the announce list. The HTML file will be dropped into
   the current working directly as 'CHANGELOG-x.y.html'. Sending the
   announcement is done by another subcommand of 'krel', not 'changelog'.

3. Commit the modified CHANGELOG-x.y.md into the main branch as well as the
   corresponding release-branch of kubernetes/kubernetes. The release branch
   will be pruned from all other CHANGELOG-*.md files which do not belong to
   this release branch.
