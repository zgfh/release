## Summary

The `changelog` subcommand of `krel` does the following things by utilizing
the golang based `release-notes` tool:

1. Generate the release notes for either a patch or a new minor release. Minor
   releases can be alpha, beta or rcâ€™s, too.

   a) Create a new `CHANGELOG-x.y.md` file if not existing.

   b) Correctly prepend the generated notes to the existing `CHANGELOG-x.y.md`
   file if already existing. This also includes the modification of the
   table of contents.

2. Convert the markdown release notes into a HTML equivalent on purpose of
   sending it by mail to the announce list. The HTML file will be dropped into
   the current working directly as `CHANGELOG-x.y.html`. Sending the
   announcement is done by another subcommand of 'krel', not 'changelog'.

3. Commit the modified CHANGELOG-x.y.md` into the master branch as well as the
   corresponding release-branch of kubernetes/kubernetes. The release branch
   will be pruned from all other CHANGELOG-\*.md files which do not belong to
   this release branch.
